Cloud API Development
=====================

Introduction
------------

With the rise of *as-a-service*-style application development, one key
challenge facing many enterprises and software vendors is to have their
software engineers learn the industry best practices on *architecting*
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

Despite the importance of API architecting, the best practices and resources
in this area are scattered and not incoherent. This open-source project aims
to provide an informational website to organize and share resources, such as
guidelines, methodologies, examples, that help organize to design, implement,
and manage APIs.

We intend to cover various aspects regarding the life-cycle of API
implementation, i.e., design, development, operation, and management, such as
the following:

* modeling and implementing an API, with its data models and formats,
* re-architecting a silo application into a mashup service provisioning APIs
  for internal and external integration,
* securing API provision with authorization and authentication, data
  encryption, and distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) protection, and
* versioning APIs.

Being the contributors to this open-source project, we are software architects
and engineers who have been developing API-equipped application services in
our own organizations and are passionate about sharing our learning and
implementaiton experiences on this website.

Being as an informational website, this project, however, does not aim to
develop any API solutions. Athough in the future we may provide coding
examples and compare relevant software tools in the market, we tend to be
netural regarding programming languages, development platforms, and software
vendors.
